A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference. -->
# Learning Flutter
This is a code along with the [video by Rivaan Ranawat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiOSCpV-lts). Will try to learn and follow along daily, and expect to complete this within 2 weeks, as I am superbusy for the next week.
See you later.
